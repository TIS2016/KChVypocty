 FOR SMELTER FUMES HAVE I BEEN NAMED,
    I AM AN EVIL POISONOUS SMOKE...
 BUT WHEN FROM POISON I AM FREED,
    THROUGH ART AND SLEIGHT OF HAND,
 THEN CAN I CURE BOTH MAN AND BEAST,
    FROM DIRE DISEASE OFTTIMES DIRECT THEM;
 BUT PREPARE ME CORRECTLY, AND TAKE GREAT CARE
    THAT YOU FAITHFULLY KEEP WATCHFUL GUARD OVER ME;
 FOR ELSE I AM POISON, AND POISON REMAIN,
    THAT PIERCES THE HEART OF MANY A ONE.
